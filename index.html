            Hello! My name is Joseph Lawrence. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web Design and
            Development.
            I have been married for 8 years and have 4 children. I love the outdoors, especially camping and hiking. I
            also enjoy reading and playing board games with my family.
